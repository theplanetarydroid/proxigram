<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Proxigram, a free and open source alternative Instagram front-end focused on privacy.
Inspired by [ProxiTox](https://github.com/pablouser1/ProxiTok) and [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/)

### Why?

We all know the record of bad pactices that Instagram and Meta has done against user's privacy. Regatherless of that, Instagram still being one of the largest social media in the world, this makes it imposible to not have to check instagram sometimes, It can be hard to use Instagram without having to go to the website/app, this is where Proxigram comes in.

There are some websites that provide Instagram information without the need of having to go to Instagram, but some of them can be a little tricky to use, most of them have ads, needs JavaScript or are full of Google captcha. Proxigram does the job for you and goes to these services and gets the most data it can gets from them, parse this data and gives it back to you.

In the future more services will be added including the official Instagram api.

Using an instance of Proxigram, you can browse Instagram without JavaScript and in a more privacy way, while retaining your privacy. In addition to respecting your privacy.

### Features
